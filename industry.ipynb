The expansion of the MDx portfolio can shorten the turnaround time and increase accuracy of diagnosis in different patient group, and leverage existing laboratory resources.\n",

Identification of risk factors particularly among hospitalised and immunocompromised individuals is crucial for successful outcomes. While currently available therapeutics have significant limitations with respect to tissue penetration, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics which can contribute to treatment failure and drug resistance, novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment and prophylaxis of severe fungal infections will enter clinical practice. In this symposium, expert faculty will discuss risk factors for invasive fungal infections (IFIs) and how to prophylaxis or diagnose and treat IFIs in light of current practice guidelines.

      "Becton Dickinson The session aims at presenting real life experiences on how working in a concerted effort amongst different healthcare stakeholders can alleviate some of the pressing pains and gaps in the diagnostic pathway. Improving the diagnostic paths to ultimately achieve better patient care and optimal utilisation of resources should move along two axes: best practice, in the broadest sense of integrated diagnostic stewardship, and innovation.  These 2 axes are not mutually exclusive but on the contrary build on each other.  Innovation on its own, without a coalition behind it and a clear change management effort may not be sufficient to maximise potential impact. The goal of rapid and accurate results is to support clinicians in making appropriate therapeutic choices. Yet there is no impact if these fast and accurate results are not communicated and acted upon in a timely matter.\n",

      "Oxford Nanopore Technologies Genomics is playing a pivotal role for applications in clinical microbiology and infectious disease, including whole-genome sequencing of bacteria and fungi from isolates, and detection of pathogens and antimicrobial resistance. However, long turnaround times, high economic costs, large device footprints, and inherent technical limitations associated with legacy sequencing platforms have hindered widespread adoption for many of these applications. Nanopore sequencing allows to overcome these limitations by providing accessible, cost-effective devices that generate accurate sequencing reads of any length, from short to ultra-long, and enable rapid turnaround times from receipt of sample to experimental answer/analysis/reporting of findings/conclusions. In this session, leading clinician researchers and scientists in this field will describe the implementation of nanopore sequencing for: (1) low-cost, flexible-throughput isolate sequencing, that produces reference-quality microbial genome assemblies for applications such as outbreak surveillance; (2) rapid detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and drug resistance directly from sputum using a targeted PCR-based approach; and (3) metagenomic detection and characterisation of lower respiratory tract infection pathogens.\n",

RSV is the most frequent cause of respiratory disease in infants and, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia, is the leading cause of hospitalisations, most of which are in otherwise healthy infants born at term. RSV also causes substantial burdens across settings and perspectives. Efforts to prevent RSV have been ongoing for decades. This symposium will present an interactive roundtable discussion regarding the issues that impact RSV, from which all infants need protection.\n",

Strategies to prevent or treat CMV infection are limited by toxicities and cross-resistance to multiple agents. Long-term administration of antivirals for treatment or dose reduction for toxicities increase the risk of drug resistance.  \n",

Interesting real-world clinical cases in CMV post-transplant provide an opportunity for you to consider how you would treat these patients, and expert opinion for optimal management. The panel will provide guidance on how to use a new antiviral maribavir in clinical practice for refractory or resistant CMV after transplantation.\n",
